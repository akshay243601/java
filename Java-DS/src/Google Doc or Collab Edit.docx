Google drive use Operational Transformation But google take 2 years to write it. It is too complex to implement


So we will go with CRDTs -> Conflict-free replicated data types


Main thing is INSERT and DELETE Operation. Whenever we are inserting or writing anything it will do insert along with its position

Suppose a doc is empty

If we write "ABC" So the operation will be 

Insert(0, 'A');
Insert(1, 'B');
Insert(2, 'C');

Similiarly Remove will work If I want to remove B from ABC
remove(1, 'B');


What if conflict occur : So As per CRDTs We will use global identifier with each element. It mean if it remove or insert at the same time unique identifier value will Insert or remove.
Each element or character will have unique id.
