Project Details and Assumption:-
1) I am assuming files are stored at the server and application is deployed on Server. So i am assuming we will give the file path (eg: C:/abc/as/test.txt)
2) I am using spring boot and maven.
3) files path will be given in array form.

Sample URL : http://localhost:8080/word/findCommonWord?files=C:/Users/guptaakshay/Desktop/demo/f1.txt,C:/Users/guptaakshay/Desktop/demo/f2.txt, C:/Users/guptaakshay/Desktop/demo/f3.txt
Response : 
{
    "message": "success",
    "data": [
        "judge",
        "objective"
    ],
    "sucess ": true
}
I am returning more specific response with status, So that if any file is missing or a any data is missing we can analyze that error. 
Success : false will show any error or wrong file. 
Success : true will show valid processing of data.



Dummy Test URL : http://localhost:8080/word/
Dummy Response : HELLO
